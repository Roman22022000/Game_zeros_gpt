A simple experiment with the [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/) library.
The window displays a blue grid of cells. Use the keyboard to explore and
manipulate the board.

## Controls
- Arrow keys – move the yellow cursor across the grid.
- Space – toggle the selected cell between blue and green.
- PageUp / PageDown – move to upper or lower stacked grid layers.

## Running
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
The script uses headless mode so it can run in environments without a
physical display.
